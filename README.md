### Evolutionary algorithms -  BRKGA

The notebook <a href='brkga_showcase.ipynb'>brkga_showcase.ipynb</a> contains an example of an implementation of a Biased-Random Key Genetic Algorithm for the Travelling Salesman Problem. More details on BRKGA, the TSP and this implementation can be found in the notebook.

The <a href='brkga.py'>brkga.py</a> contains a vanilla implementation of a BRKGA and a more complex one which grows separate populations in parallel until merging them for a final elitist evolution.

Tecnical skills on display:
- evolutionary heuristics
- parallel processing
- efficient programing using numpy
- visualizations with matplolib
- hyperparameter optimization using optuna
